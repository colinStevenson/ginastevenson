        <p>
          Seeking out the mystery and challenges of the force of nature through my landscape studies, my paintings allow for an encounter with the chaos as well as the meditative and quiet realms. Within the canvas it seems there is something about to happen. There is often energetic and gestural movement of form that exemplifies the changing natural world. Robust and fragile in the same moment. Working from memory and invention as a way to interpret the soul and beauty of nature, I paint from my minds eye.
